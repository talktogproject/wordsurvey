# YOU ARE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN TALKTOGETHER
## Pilot Phase

TalkTogether is a research project conducted by experts from the University of Oxford and The Promise Foundation. It aims to understand how children develop their language skills, including Kannada, English, and the mother tongues. 

We are looking for parents, teachers, or local language experts to participate in a Kannada language survey. We will set up a call at a time that is convenient for you.  Each session would take about 30 to 45 minutes of your time.  We will give you sets of words in Kannada.  For each word you will tell us when you think they are first understood by children. We will also ask you to tell us how easy or difficult it is to visualise or make a picture of the word in our mind. We will also ask for your honest feedback about your experience of answering the survey.
